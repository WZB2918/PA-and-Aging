# PA-and-Aging
This is most of the raw material and part of the code used to reproduce our study 
"The association between objectively measured physical activity and aging: based on isotemporal substitution model" 
except for "paxraw_c and paxraw_d" because these two files are too large, 
but they can be obtained from the NHANES website at the following addressï¼š
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2003-2004/PAXRAW_C.ZIP and
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2005-2006/PAXRAW_D.ZIP
